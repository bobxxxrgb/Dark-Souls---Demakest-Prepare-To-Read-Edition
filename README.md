Dark Souls - Demakest: Prepare to Read Edition (Demo Build)

i'd love to state this is the both most futile and time expansive project of my life,
but at least i guess i'm learning programming in c++ and having fun in the process

this is a terminal text based strategic rpg based on Dark Souls,
no apis, no engines, no shaders, no bells and whistles, remaining in subject,
just you, a basic text gui and less that the majority of the features
the original Dark Souls could provide to you almost 16 years ago,
i mean what more could you ask for after two weeks of non paid labour?
i'm a souls and vintage passionate so i wondered, why not mix them together?
if i'm alive to the end of this project i may retrieve some old
floppy drives and play this on one of them.
and, i mean, it will take forever for this game to reach a megabyte too,
we're barealy at 1/10 of that for now so i guess we're not that far off.

the windows repo is momentarily empty since i'm on linux and i'm building from here.
like getting to the point i basically reduced to the minimum the
public i could possibly have, like having no sponsors, no experience,
no cool engines to showoff to the vast majority of people that could
never understand true vintage beauty, might as well half my poeple again
sidekicking everyone who uses windows and forcing them to manually compile
my source code on their own.
for all two of them, 0819.c is the up to date version.
but you'll have to track it on linux brench up here.

as you could imagine from my upright definition, this is a terminal game.
drop the file on your open terminal window, after sudo chown for linux users in the hall,
track the executable in your task manager and close it if you double clicked it by mistake, 
or else it will continue to mess up the aformentioned saves folder running in the background,
tap enter and you're on board.

i thought it could have been a nice inclusion to drop you
the source code for all my non paid labout thus far,
since c++ is a pretty basic lenguage and i couldnt possibly
have the skills to come up with something homebrew that i could
have interests in keeping private, and this source code
could lead to someone even less handy than me to get up and
running on their feet.
but from this build on i won't include the source code anymore
because i'm willing to include some cool stuff as a secret for
you to find directly in game, it wouldnt be funny if you read it
in the souce code, right?
for all two of you, just take a glance at what you could expect
from this project, for now.

be jolly. do cooperation. don't you dare go hollow.

if this project starts to draw serious interest on me i'm running naked for a mile.
